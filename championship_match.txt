SmartyPants plays his nickel and takes the 2c change.
2c from 5c isn't great, a 2c loss, 
but the alternative at this point is to play 1c and give MCTS 3c change from a 5c coin.

1
0x1, 0x5, 0x10, 0x25

So does MCTS. At this point the two players both have 3c in pennies and 2 dimes.
MCTS also has 25c in nickels, where as SmartyPants also has is quarter, plus a nickel.
In change value, at this point it looks like SmartyPants is winning.
MCTS needs to use his remaining coins carefully to stop that 25c from being converted to change.

10
0x1, 1x5, 0x10, 0x25

Another 4c loss doesn't look good for MCTS.

25
1x1, 0x5, 2x10, 0x25

SmartyPants plays his quarter, picking up 21c in change, matching MCTS's earlier move.
It's worth noting at this point that with both quarters played, dimes can't be picked up.
