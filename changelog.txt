C & C++ Fight Change Log
------------------------

v1.9a (2013.10.26)
* Added support for excluding bots with the command line: -xName
* Added support for setting games-per-match with command line: -g...
  Where ... is a number > 0
* Added support for controlling tournaments run by command line: -t...
  Where ... is 0-N letters, 1 per tournament, 'e' for elimination, 'r' for round-robin.
* Added support for output of results in JSON format via the command line: -oj
* Bug fixes.

v1.9 (2013.10.26)
* Added the ability to add a bot written in any language to the player list.
External bots are implemented as console applications, which tread game-state from std-in,
and write their move to std out. External bots are added via the command line, like so:

  -n"command-line" "Bot Name" "Author Name"
  
* Added the ability to run any chosen bot in "single move mode", accepting game state on 
std-in and writing game state to std-out. Single move mode is selected via the command:

  -m"Bot Name"
  
Note: These two features can be tested together:

  ./a.out -n"./a.out -mGreedy" ExternalBot Mandelbrot

* Added example game state "game.txt". Game state has the first line:
[Player Count] [Move Number]
The next [Player Count]+1 lines are in the form:
[Quantity]x[Face Value],[...]
With the 1st being the game change pool, and the rest being the players current change.
